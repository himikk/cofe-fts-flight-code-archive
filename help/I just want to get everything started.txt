No problem. This file describes how to start every computer, and provides basic information about how to tell if something is horribly wrong. If something is horribly wrong, generally the only fix is to restart the program.

--TELESCOPE COMPUTERS--
There's a folder on the desktop called "telescope". In that folder is "telescope.bat". Double-click it. That's it!

Expected behavior: two windows will appear: one for the raw-data-gathering process, and one to read/demodulate/send the .dat files generated by the data-gatherer. The data-gathering process should be pretty quiet after it wakes up. The read/demod/send process should spend most of its time saying "Wrote <N> bytes" or "Already sent <filename>; Sleeping" if it's connected to the flight computer, though it may rarely say "Timed out while writing." If it is has not connected to the flight computer since starting, it will be pretty quiet, and if it was connected at some point but is no longer, it will print an error message every few seconds until the connection is reestablished.

 If the demod/send code is printing errors, unless you're sure that the connection *should* be able to be reestablished (e.g. you can ping one computer from the other) you don't need to restart it. If you're sure it should be able to connect, but it isn't, you'll need to restart either that code or its counterpart on the servo computer -- something's gone wrong with one of them.


--SERVO COMPUTER--
On the desktop, in the "flight" folder, there is a file called "flight.bat". Double-click it. That's it!

Expected behavior: you'll get four windows: "T1 glue", "T2 glue", "telemetry glue", and "Flight code". The flight code is the workhorse here: the other three windows just provide information about the connection to the telescope and ground computers. The T1 and T2 glue windows act just like the server on the telescope, except replace "Wrote <N> bytes" with "Read <N> bytes." The telemetry glue acts just like the telescope server. The flight code should show a block of numbers for each device, and there may be enough stuff that it can't fit it all on the screen, so it's super-jittery. That's okay.


--GROUND COMPUTER--
In C:\Lab\Data_1\COFE\git\Release\ground, there is a file called "ground.py". Double-click it. That's it!

Expected behavior: four windows will open: "Fast telemetry glue", "Fast telemetry", "Slow telemetry", and "Groundstation". The glue window should act just like the servo computer telescope glue. The fast and slow telemetry windows should say "Successfully opened <some comm port>" and a few other things, and then once every twelve seconds say "Wrote to file just fine." The files they receive should appear in folders specified in the ground configuration file, currently "C:\Lab\Data_1\COFE\Flight...Sumner\Preflight\Ground data".

The groundstation will ask you for a directory. Give it the same one the telemetry code is pointed at: it should contain one or more folders named YYYYMMDD (dates). (So if a folder called "Target" has a subdirectory named "20110822" that spaceball files are appearing in, select "Target" with the groundstation.) Further documentation is provided in Release/ground/groundstation/help.txt.
