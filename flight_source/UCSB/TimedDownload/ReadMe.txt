Please read Configuration.cfg.  Otherwise I have to keep documentation in two places and in sync.
Since I suck at that, you are going to have to do your part and simply read the one place where
it makes sense to have the documentation.

If the code has been fixed then you can see the documenation by using:
[appname] /?
